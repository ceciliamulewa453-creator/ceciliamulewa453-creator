# 👋 Hi, I'm Cecilliah Muli!

I'm a curious and motivated student who recently stepped into the world of programming. I got into coding not just to learn a new skill, but to push myself—to grow by doing something challenging and unfamiliar.

## 🚀 What I'm All About

🌱 **Learning:**  
I may be new to programming, but I'm not new to putting in the effort. I believe that being smart is not just about knowing things—it's about being willing to **ask questions, explore, fail, and try again**.

🧠 **Growth Mindset:**  
Every bug is an opportunity, every error message is a lesson. I'm not afraid to be a beginner, because I know that's how all experts start.

🤝 **Collaboration:**  
I love working with others, especially when it comes to building, learning, and sharing ideas. I'm open to internships, mentorship, or even just a good conversation about code and creativity.

## 🔧 Tech I'm Currently Learning

- Python 🐍  
- HTML & CSS 🌐  
- JavaScript (just started!)  
- Git & GitHub 🛠️  

## 📌 What You’ll Find Here

- 💡 Simple projects as I learn new concepts  
- 📘 Notes and documentation from what I’ve learned  
- 🌟 A reflection of my journey from “newbie” to “developer”

## 🌟 A Little More About Me

When I’m not coding or debugging, I enjoy exploring life through my hobbies:

- 🧁 **Baking** – I love experimenting in the kitchen and creating sweet treats  
- 🍜 **Trying out food** – Whether it's street food or a new restaurant, I'm always up for a good bite  
- 🚶 **Taking walks** – A good walk clears my mind and fuels new ideas  
- ✈️ **Traveling** – I love discovering new places, cultures, and perspectives  

I believe these experiences make me a more curious, grounded, and creative thinker—both in life and in code.

## 🤝 Let's Connect!

If you're looking for someone who’s **driven, eager to learn, and ready to contribute**, I’d love to hear from you—whether it’s an internship, a project, or just a chat.
